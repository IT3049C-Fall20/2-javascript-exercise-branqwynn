## Self-Reflection:
During this mini project, things were pretty easy at first but when I go to the arrays and objects I was stuck for hours because the error codes were very confusing and the code looked right but I adjusted a lot of code. Other than that I found this project pretty fun and somewhat easy.

### How long it took me to finish this?
4-5 hours with breaks
